# Fake-product-identification-using-Blockchain
Our objective is to design a phoney product detection system using blockchain technology to safeguard brand
value and duplicate threat. to protect and authenticate the product information that aids in
the traceability and identity of the exact product across the supply chain. All product
information is safeguarded and kept in a QR code or product ID that aids in identification and
is kept in tamper-proof blockchain blocks for further security. Manufacturers can upload
product information, and the system generates a QR code that can be used by distributors
and merchants for tracking, as well as by customers to ensure they are buying authentic
products.
